        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
		Bo Kho is a Vietnamese beef stew seasoned with traditional fragrants such as lemongrass, star anime, and cinnamon. The stew is pot-roasted, with beef that will fall apart and soft carrots to compliment the beef. Turnips, daikon radish, and potatoes are often added. It is typically served with rice, rice noodles, or a freshly baked baguette.

	<h4>Steps</h4>

		<li>Put beef in large bowl, add marinade and massage meat. Marinate for at least 15 minutes.</li>
		<li>Put oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, fry the beef cubes in small batches until nicely browned. When all beef is browned, return chunks to put. Add shallots, stir to combine and continue cooking for 4-5 minutes, or until softened.</li>
		<li>Add tomato, ginger, garlic, lemongrass, salt, and annatto (optional) and stir well to coat. Then, add star anise, cinnamon and chile. Cover with 4 cups water and bring to a boil.</li>

		<li>Add carrots to the pot and cook for another 15 minutes. Skim fat from surface of the broth as necessary. Alternatively, refrigerate overnight and remove congealed fat before reheating.</li>
