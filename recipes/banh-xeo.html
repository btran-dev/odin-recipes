		<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Make the crepe batter: mix rice flour, sugar, salt, tumeric together in a large bowl. Beat in coconut milk until thick. Slowly beat in water until it reaches the consistency of a thin crepe batter.</li>
				<li>Make the filling: heat 1 1/2 tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallot and garlic, then cook until fragrant but not browned (1-2 mins). Add shrimp, then saute until cooked through and opaque (3-4 mins). Season with fish sauce and salt. Transfer filling to a bowl.</li>
				<li>Preheat overn to 200F (95C)</li>
				<li>Wipe out the skillet and reheat over medium heat. Add remaining 1/2 tbsp. of oil. Stir crepe batter and pour 1/2 cup into the hot skillet, swiling to coat the bottom. Lay 3-4 cooked shrimp on the bottom half of the crepe. Top with a small handful of bean sprouts. Cook until batter looks set and edges start to brown (~1 min). Fold crepe over and slide onto an oven-safe plate.</li>
				<li>Place crepe in preheated oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter, shrimp, and bean sprouts.</li>
				<li>Serve crepes with lettuce leaves. Break off pieces of crepe and roll them up in lettuce to eat.</li>
